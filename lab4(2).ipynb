    "__INTRODUCTION__: In this lab, we will look at airfoil shape optimisation using the simulator introduced in Lab 3 and the geometry tools that we have developed in Labs 1 and 2. We will use parametric airfoil geometries and then investigate how the airfoil performance depends on the geometry parameters. We will also use optimisation tools to find optimal geometries more rigorously than by trial and error.\n",
